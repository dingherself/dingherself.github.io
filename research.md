### "Two Senses in Which Freedom Might (Not) Require Alternative Possibilities" (complete draft available upon request)

*Abstract*: The dominant approach to the question of whether freedom requires alternative possibilities is preoccupied with putative counterexamples to the principle of alternative possibilities (PAP). Unfortunately, the dominant approach has resulted in deep confusion and stalemate. I argue that the failure of the dominant approach consists in its failure to distinguish *necessary presence* and *metaphysical grounding* as two importantly different senses in which freedom might (or might not) require alternative possibilities.

I demonstrate the methodological fruitfulness of the distinction by applying it to two debates: the debate between the flicker of freedom defense and the robustness objection, and the debate over a so-called IRR assumption in Frankfurt's argument against PAP. In doing so, I end up pursuing a version of what Sally Haslanger has called *ameliorative* or *analytical* inquiries in the feminist philosophical literature. I conclude that adopting such an ameliorative approach has the potential of moving things forward much more constructively than does the dominant approach.
