### “On Our Own Terms: Trans Women Crafting the Meaning of ‘Woman’”

Leading philosophical accounts of “woman” follow a *top-down* approach: they begin with what being a woman means to cis women within dominant cultural spaces and social relations, and then struggle to apply and extend that analysis to trans women. Instead of fitting trans women awkwardly into a top-down analysis that wasn’t built for us in the first place, this essay hopes to explore a trans feminist alternative, a *bottom-up* approach that aims to take up trans women’s own interpretation of our richly and wonderfully varied bodies on our own terms—a creative practice of meaning crafting facilitated by and deeply rooted in shared hermeneutical resources in trans communities more broadly. In the case of womanhood, such a bottom-up analysis suggests that “woman” means, and properly means, what trans feminism, not the dominant cisheterosexist society, makes of it.

### “Pregnant Persons as a Gender Category: A Trans Feminist Analysis of Sex Discrimination”

How should we make sense of pregnancy discrimination as a form of sex discrimination? In a striking 1974 case, *Geduldig v. Aiello*, the U.S. Supreme Court has answered that we simply *cannot*—on the Court’s analysis, pregnancy discrimination is not itself based on sex because the line drawn there is between *pregnant women* and *nonpregnant persons*, not women and men. Unfortunately, in response to the *Geduldig* line of cases, feminist philosophers of law have too often doubled down on an awkwardly cissexist conception of gender, identifying the sex discrimination in the direct relation pregnancy is thought to bear on womanhood and thus sex. In this essay, I develop a trans feminist account of pregnancy discrimination. I argue that pregnancy discrimination is based on sex not because pregnancy is in one way or another distinctive of women as a gender, but because pregnant persons constitute a gender category of their own, one that overlaps with, yet remains irreducible to, the category of women. When a pregnant person is discriminated against because of pregnancy, then, they are discriminated against not as a woman but *as a pregnant person*—that is, directly and immediately, *because of their gender*.
