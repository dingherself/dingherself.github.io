### “Pregnant Persons as a Gender Category: A Trans Feminist Analysis of Pregnancy Discrimination”

*Abstract*: How should we make sense of pregnancy discrimination as a form of sex discrimination? In a striking 1974 case, *Geduldig v. Aiello*, the U.S. Supreme Court has answered that we simply cannot—on the Court’s analysis, it is just not conceptually possible for pregnancy discrimination to be based on sex because the distinction being drawn is between *pregnant women* and *nonpregnant persons*, not between women and men. Unfortunately, in responding to the *Geduldig* line of cases, feminist philosophers of law have often appealed to an awkwardly essentialist conception of gender, identifying the sex discrimination in the “direct” relation pregnancy is thought to bear on womanhood. In this essay, I develop a trans feminist account of pregnancy discrimination, one that takes seriously the authenticity of trans/nonbinary people’s genders. My account begins with the recognition that it’s an analytical mistake to conflate gender categories with the categories of women and men. Instead, I suggest that any adequate account of pregnancy discrimination as sex discrimination must respect pregnant persons as a gender category in its own right and as on equal ontic standing with women and men. So conceived, the pluralist trans feminism offered here is not only a *political* but an *ontological* gender egalitarianism—in virtue of this, it is capable of safely disentangling womanhood from reproductive biology without discounting the irreducibly gendered ways in which pregnant persons are systematically targeted for injustices qua pregnant persons.
