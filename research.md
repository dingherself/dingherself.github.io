### “Pregnant Persons as a Gender Category: A Trans Feminist Analysis of Pregnancy Discrimination”

*Abstract*: How should we make sense of pregnancy discrimination as a form of sex discrimination? In a striking 1974 case, *Geduldig v. Aiello*, the U.S. Supreme Court answered that we simply *could* not—on the Court’s analysis, it was just not conceptually possible for pregnancy discrimination to be based on sex because the line being drawn was between *pregnant women* and *nonpregnant persons*, not women and men. Unfortunately, in response to the *Geduldig* line of cases, feminist philosophers of law have too often doubled down on an awkwardly cissexist conception of gender, identifying the sex discrimination in the *direct* relation pregnancy is thought to bear on womanhood and thus sex. In this essay, I develop a trans feminist account of pregnancy discrimination that takes seriously the authenticity of trans/nonbinary people’s genders. I argue that pregnancy discrimination is based on sex not because pregnancy is in one way or another distinctive of women as a gender, but because pregnant persons constitute a gender category of their own, one that overlaps with yet remains irreducible to the category of women. So conceived, the pluralist trans feminism offered here is not only a *political* but an *ontological* gender egalitarianism. In virtue of this, I suggest, it is capable of safely disentangling womanhood from reproductive biology without discounting the irreducibly gendered ways in which pregnant persons are systematically targeted for injustices qua pregnant persons.
