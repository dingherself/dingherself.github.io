### “Pregnant Persons as a Gender Category: A Trans Feminist Analysis of Pregnancy Discrimination”

*Abstract*: How should we make sense of pregnancy discrimination as a form of sex discrimination? In a striking 1974 case, *Geduldig v. Aiello*, the U.S. Supreme Court has answered that we simply cannot—on the Court’s analysis, it is just not conceptually possible for pregnancy discrimination to be based on sex because the distinction being drawn is between *pregnant women* and *nonpregnant persons*, not between women and men. Unfortunately, in responding to the *Geduldig* line of cases, feminist philosophers of law have often appealed to an awkwardly appealed to an awkwardly cisnormative conception of gender, identifying the sex discrimination in the unique relation pregnancy is thought to bear on womanhood. In this essay, I develop a trans feminist account of pregnancy discrimination that aims to take seriously the authenticity of trans/nonbinary people's genders. On my account, pregnancy discrimination is based on sex not because pregnancy is in one way or another unique to women, but because pregnant persons constitute a gender category of their own, one that overlaps with yet remains irreducible to the category of women. So conceived, the pluralist trans feminism offered here is not only a *political* but an *ontological* gender egalitarianism. In virtue of this, it is capable of safely disentangling womanhood from reproductive biology without discounting the irreducibly gendered ways in which pregnant persons are systematically targeted for injustices qua pregnant persons.
