### “Pregnant Persons as a Gender Category: A Trans Feminist Analysis of Pregnancy Discrimination”

*Abstract*: How should we make sense of pregnancy discrimination as a form of sex discrimination? In a striking 1974 case, *Geduldig v. Aiello*, the U.S. Supreme Court answered that we simply *couldn’t*—on the Court’s analysis, it was just not conceptually possible for pregnancy discrimination to be based on sex because the line being drawn was between *pregnant women* and *nonpregnant persons*, not women and men. Unfortunately, in response to the *Geduldig* line of cases, feminist philosophers of law have too often doubled down on an awkwardly cissexist conception of gender, identifying the sex discrimination in the direct relation pregnancy is thought to bear on womanhood and thus sex. In this essay, I develop a trans feminist account of pregnancy discrimination that takes seriously the authenticity of trans/nonbinary people’s genders. I argue that pregnancy discrimination is based on sex not because pregnancy is in one way or another distinctive of women as a gender, but because pregnant persons constitute a gender category of their own, one that overlaps with yet remains irreducible to the category of women. When a pregnant person is discriminated against because of pregnancy, they are discriminated against not as a woman but *as a pregnant person*—that is, directly and immediately, *because of their gender*. This way, my view enables us to safely disentangle womanhood from reproductive biology without discounting the irreducibly gendered ways in which pregnant persons are systematically targeted for injustices qua pregnant persons.
