# OpenPGP

For email encryption/signing (note that the private key for this one is <a href="https://proton.me/support/how-is-the-private-key-stored" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managed by Proton</a>, though they claim not to have access to the password that protects it):

- [D5B6 62BA 3D3C A34D 9DA2  0E48 012F EA2B 0F6D 4723](https://openpgpkey.dingthemself.com/D5B662BA3D3CA34D9DA20E48012FEA2B0F6D4723.asc)

If better security is needed, encrypt your message to this key (which I keep offline) and send it over directly in plain text:

- [799D A37A 5A20 DC45 6ECB  55A6 2D86 424E 27FC 7AE9](https://openpgpkey.dingthemself.com/799DA37A5A20DC456ECB55A62D86424E27FC7AE9.asc)

This site supports WKD and you can get the keys that way too.
