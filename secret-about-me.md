# About Me (Secret Version)

**N.B. In accordance with [*the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy*](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy) of 1692, any muggle that happens to be reading this page will be obliviated.**

I'm a philosopher in the Department of Magical Theory, [Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny). I passed my [N.E.W.T exams](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Nastily_Exhausting_Wizarding_Test) while at Hufflepuff House, Hogwarts School.

My research centers on the philosophy of magic. I'm most interested in the metaphysics of magic: What is magic? Is magic reducible to (muggle-)physical terms? What give rise to magical abilities---physiology, wands, or social relations? And how? I do not think, however, at least at the present time, we have *any* good answer to those questions, and I have argued against both of the two dominant views in the field---panmagicalism and physicalism.

(For an introduction to the metaphysics of magic, see [this](https://mmsl.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Concepts_in_the_Theory_of_Magic/The_Metaphysics_of_Magic).)

I have also written on the ethics and political philosophy of magic, especially with regard to the proper relationship between muggles and wizards/witches, and the moral status of magical creatures.

Finally, I work on the intersection between the philosophy of magic and contemporary muggle philosophy. For example, I have argued that phenomenal consciousness is best understood as a magical process/state, so the hard problem of consciousness is really the problem of explaining magic.
