# About Me (Secret Version)

**In accordance with *the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy* of 1692, any muggle that happens to be reading this page will be obliviated.**

I'm a philosopher in the Department of Magical Theory, [Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny). I serve on the editorial board of *Ilvermorny Review of Magical Theory & Philosophy*. I passed my N.E.W.T exams while at Hufflepuff House, Hogwarts School.

My research centers on the philosophy of magic. I'm most interested in the metaphysics of magic: What is magic? Is magic explainable in (muggle-)physical terms? What grounds magical abilities---physiology, wands, or social relations? I do not think, however, at least at the present time, we have *any* good answer to those questions, and I have argued against both of the two dominant views in the field---panmagicalism and physicalism.

I have also written on the ethics and political philosophy of magic, especially with regard to the proper relationship between muggles and wizards/witches, and the moral status of magical creatures.

Finally, I work on the intersection between the philosophy of magic and contemporary muggle philosophy. I have argued that phenomenal consciousness is best understood as a magical process/state, so the hard problem of consciousness is really the problem of explaining magic.
