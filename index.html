<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>In August of 2019, I will join the philosophy department at the University of Arizona as a doctoral student.</p>

<p>I’m primarily interested in political and moral philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind. I have additional interests in the history of early analytic philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophical logic, and philosophical methodology. Still, what fascinate me most are questions that arise at the nexus of different areas of philosophy, and of philosophy and other disciplines.</p>

<p>Before joining Arizona, I earned a B.A. in philosophy from The Ohio State University. I was an instructor of OSU’s Media, Marketing and Communication (MMC) Scholars program for three years, where I taught the After Effects and Nuke project groups.</p>


<h3>A Note on My Name</h3>

<p>While I was previously known as “Zhiyuan Li” (which remains my legal name), I would appreciate
being known professionally as “Ding” due to family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both
  a first name and a last name.</p>
