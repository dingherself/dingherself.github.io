<h1 style="font-size: 1.125rem">Welcome!</h1>

<p>I’m a graduate student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. I work primarily on issues at the intersection of feminist political philosophy, social metaphysics, and philosophy of constitutional law.</p>

<p>My current research explores a theory of gender equality that aims to take both the metaphysics (the gender part) and the political philosophy (the equality part) seriously. Along the way, I defend a realist account of gender rooted in trans people’s meaning crafting practice, a social meaning account of discrimination that situates the legal issue of discrimination within a broader political struggle for equality, and an equality-based account of trans feminism that goes beyond authority and autonomy. I also have a growing interest in the history of second-wave feminism.</p>

<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>
