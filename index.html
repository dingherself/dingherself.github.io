<h1 style="font-size: 1.125rem; padding-top: 2pt;">Welcome!</h1>

<p>I’m a PhD student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. I work primarily on issues at the intersection of feminist political philosophy, social metaphysics, and philosophy of constitutional law.</p>

<p>My current research explores an account of gender equality that aims to take both the gender part (the metaphysics) and the equality part (the political philosophy) seriously, with a view to its implications for transgender equality in particular. Along the way, I defend a realist account of gender which grounds facts about a person’s gender identification in facts about their gender, not the other way around; a social meaning account of discrimination which situates the legal issue of discrimination within a broader political struggle for equality; and an equality-based account of trans feminism that goes beyond authority and autonomy. I also have a growing historical interest in the participation of—and controversies over—<a href="https://repository.duke.edu/dc/wlmpc/wlmms01011">lesbian</a> and <a href="https://revolution.berkeley.edu/diary-mad-organizer-wclc-conference">trans women</a> in the early days of the women’s liberation movement.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">A note on my last name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">And a note on pronouns</h2>
<p>I go by <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they">they/them</a> and she/her.</p>
