<h2>Welcome!</h2>
https://philosophy.arizona.edu/user/ding-zhiyuan-li
<p>I’m a graduate student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. Before that, I studied at The Ohio State University.</p>
  
<p>My philosophical interests are very broad. When forced, I will usually explain to people that I'm most interested in some combination of value theory, metaphysics and logic/semantics. For some reason, however vague and uninformative that explanation is, people seem to find it satisfying. Then, so be it?</p>

<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
  var c = "g-cv.pdf";
  var u = "din";
  var arr = "@";
  var b = "email";
  var d = "arizona";
  var dot = ".";
  var t = "edu";
  var s = " ";
  document.write("You can view my CV" + s + "<a href=" + "files/" + u + c +">" + "here" + "</a>." + s + "Please email me at" + s + "<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + u + arr + b + dot + d + dot + t
        + ">" + u + arr + b + dot + d + dot + t + "</a>" + ".");
</script>

<h3>A Note on My Name</h3>

<p>While I was previously known as “Zhiyuan Li” (which remains my legal name), I would appreciate
being known professionally as “Ding” due to family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both
  a first name and a last name.</p>

<p><em>Pronouns:</em> they/them.</p>
