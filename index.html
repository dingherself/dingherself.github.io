<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I’m a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. I’m primarily interested in political and moral philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind. I have additional interests in the history of early analytic philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophical logic, and philosophical methodology. Still, what fascinate me most are questions that arise at the nexus of different areas of philosophy, and of philosophy and other disciplines.</p>

<p>The best way to contact me is via <a href="mailto:{{ 'ding@dingphil.com' | encode_email }}">email</a>.</p>
