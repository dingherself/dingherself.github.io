<h1 style="font-size: 1.125rem; padding-top: 2pt;">Welcome!</h1>

<p>I’m a PhD student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. I work primarily on issues at the intersection of feminist political philosophy, social metaphysics, and philosophy of constitutional law.</p>

<p>My current research examines the underappreciated ways in which transgender equality at once poses pressing challnges to, and sheds novel light on, the meaning of gender equality. Along the way, I defend a social meaning account of discrimination which situates the legal issue of discrimination within a broader political struggle for equality; a realist account of gender that grounds facts about a person’s gender identification in facts about their gender, not the other way around; and together, a trans feminist account of gender equality that takes both the gender (the metaphysics) and the equality (the political philosophy) of gender equality seriously.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">A note on my last name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>
