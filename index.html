<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I’m a first-year doctoral student in the Department of Philosophy, University of Arizona. I’m primarily interested in political and moral philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind. I have additional interests in the history of early analytic philosophy, feminist philosophy, and philosophical methodology. Still, what fascinate me most are questions that arise at the nexus of different areas of philosophy, and of philosophy and other disciplines.</p>

<p>I earned my B.A. in philosophy from The Ohio State University. I was an instructor of OSU’s Media, Marketing and Communication (MMC) Scholars program for three years, where I taught the After Effects and Nuke project groups.</p>
