<h1 style="font-size: 1.125rem; padding-top: 2pt;">Welcome!</h1>

<p>I’m a PhD student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. My research focuses on issues at the intersection of feminist political philosophy, social metaphysics, and philosophy of law.</p>

<p>My dissertation examines the conceptual challenges that transgender equality poses to leading theories of gender equality, and in so doing, motivates and develops a trans feminist alternative. To account for transgender equality in a way that speaks to trans people’s lived genders and gender realities on trans people’s own terms, I argue that feminist theory needs to take seriously both the gender (the social metaphysics) and the equality (the political philosophy) of gender equality, not just one or the other.</p>

<p>I’m apparently also on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dingherself">@dingherself</a>), for some reason.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">A note on my last name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">And a note on pronouns</h2>
<p>I go by <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they">they/them</a> and she/her.</p>
