<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I’m a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. I’m primarily interested in political and moral philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind. I have additional interests in the history of early analytic philosophy, feminist philosophy, and philosophical methodology. Still, what fascinate me most are questions that arise at the intersections of different areas of philosophy, and of philosophy and other disciplines.</p>
