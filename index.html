<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I'm a <a href="https://philosophy.arizona.edu/people/ding-zhiyuan-li">graduate student in philosophy</a> at the University of Arizona. Before moving to the gorgious Sonoran desert, I was quite used to finding myself buried in some pretty deep snow while I studied at The Ohio State University. But in Chengdu, where I grew up, snow is also a rare treat (I still remember this one time in primary school, when my teacher canceled class just to let us play with snow in the playground!), so I'm feeling right at home now.</p>

<p>My philosophical interests are very broad. When forced, I usually explain to people that I'm most interested in the intersections of value theory and metaphysics. However vague and uninformative that explanation is, people tend to find it satisfying, or at least they appear to. Then, so be it?</p>

<p>Outside academic philosophy, I'm really into <a href="https://www.dingphil.com/aviation/">aviation</a>. I taught visual effects as part of an Honors & Scholars program back at Ohio State for three years. I also build and maintain websites. I occasionally write and edit for <a href="https://herstoria.me">Herstoria</a>, a feminist blog that's sort of well-known in Chinese feminist circles. Many of my public writings (in Mandarin) since 2018 are also available on <a href="https://matters.news/@ding">Matters</a>.</p>

<h3>A Note on My Name</h3>

<p>While I was previously known as “Zhiyuan Li” (which remains my legal name), I would appreciate
being known professionally as “Ding” due to family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both
  a first name and a last name.</p>

<h3>And a Note on Pronouns</h3>

<p>I go by they/them.</p>
