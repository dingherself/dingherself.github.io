<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I'm a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. I’m primarily interested in political and moral philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind. I have additional interests in the history of early analytic philosophy, feminist philosophy, and philosophical methodology. Still, what fascinate me most are questions that arise at the intersections of different areas of philosophy, and of philosophy and other disciplines. Apart from philosophy, I regularly teach After Effects (an industry standard program for motion graphics and visual effects) for the University's Media, Marketing and Communication Scholars program.</p>

	<p>I'm a huge fan of aviation, especially commercial jet aircrafts. I run a virtual airline online (see our <a href="https://yeager.airlinesim.aero/app/info/enterprises/892">schedules and routes</a>), and I keep track of the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airliners.md %}'>airliners</a> I have flown on and the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airports.md %}">airports</a> I have been to. My flight map is <a href="https://my.flightradar24.com/shannon403">here</a>.</p>
