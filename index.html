    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>Driven by a wave of trans-antagonistic laws, arguments, and practices, recent feminist theorizing on trans issues has focused on retrofitting trans people into existing public, legal, medical, and philosophical conceptions of gender embodiment. At the end of the day, this is a defensive and reactive strategy which attempts to make trans lives make sense first and foremost to a dominant political and cultural world, not necessarily on trans people’s own terms.</p>
    <p>I argue for a different way forward. Engaging closely with ways in which legal, medical, and carceral institutions define, administer, discipline, and reify gender from the top down through hidden but operative conceptual frameworks, my research proposes an alternative theory of gender that begins with trans people’s lived material realities from the ground up. Taking evolving doctrinal and philosophical issues in gender equality law as my point of departure, I argue that such a bottom-up theory is crucial to securing equal justice for trans people, offer it as a constructive intervention to facilitate meaningful social change and self-understanding, and show that it resolves long-standing conceptual and methodological problems that continue to frustrate feminist theory and politics today. It turns out that lived trans experiences not only pose difficult challenges to, but more constructively shed refreshing light on, our understanding of the meaning and requirements of gender equality.</p>

            <p>How should we make sense of pregnancy discrimination as an issue of gender equality? In a striking 1974 decision, <em>Geduldig v. Aiello</em>, the U.S. Supreme Court has answered that we simply cannot. Pregnancy discrimination does not constitute a form of sex discrimination prohibited by law, the 6–3 decision claims, because differential treatment based on pregnancy draws only a gender-neutral line between “pregnant women” and “nonpregnant persons,” not the gender line between women and men. While courts have since invoked <em>Geduldig</em> to curtail both reproductive and transgender rights, the prevailing feminist response to this line of cases is still to double down on an awkwardly cissexist conception of gender, finding the sex discrimination in the “direct” way that pregnancy is thought to connect to womanhood. The failure of that prevailing feminist response, legitimizing rather than challenging biological essentialism in legal analysis and public discourse, epitomizes a broader failure of feminist analysis and intersectional solidarity: it fails to confront the political and social problem that is pregnancy discrimination for either cis or trans people. This essay offers a trans feminist alternative. I argue that pregnancy discrimination is discrimination on the basis of sex, within the legally relevant meaning of that phrase, not because pregnancy is in one way or another distinctive to women as a gender category but because pregnant persons make up a gender category of their own. On my analysis, pregnancy discrimination comes out as a form of sex discrimination directly and immediately, not by way of womanhood.</p>

            <p>Philosophical discussions of gender have not adequately appreciated the metaphysical significance of the creative, collaborative practice by which trans people come to invent and reinvent interpretations of our bodies that for the first time make genuine sense of our lived genders and gender realities on our own terms—a practice that I call <em>trans meaning crafting</em>. As a result, current philosophical work has missed out a lot on what gender as an empirical phenomenon even <em>is</em>, never mind what it can do for trans people. Drawing on a wide range of trans meaning crafting practices with a focus on trans women’s negotiation of sexual intimacy in particular, this essay motivates an analysis of trans meaning crafting as a distinctively trans feminist approach to the metaphysics of gender, on the model of inference to the best explanation. I argue that the meanings crafted by trans people on our own terms are metaphysically privileged for the straightforward reason that they best explain gender reality as we live and interpret it. Trans meaning crafting, so clarified, brings to light an <em>empirical</em> and <em>explanatory</em> basis for affirming trans people’s lived genders, not merely a moral and political one, as the literature is increasingly resorting to.</p>

            <p>Conceptual hang-ups can have real, material consequences. In a recent wave of cases, a growing number of federal courts in the U.S. have held that it is conceptually impossible for discriminatory legislation targeting trans people to violate constitutional guarantees of gender equality on the theory that trans-discriminatory legislation applies equally to all trans persons regardless of gender. In fact, some have gone still further to suggest that such legislation cannot be said to target trans people in the first place since the discrimination may be easily redescribed as applicable to only persons diagnosed with gender dysphoria, only persons seeking gender-affirming care, or only some other category of persons similarly thought to be gender-neutral—but not trans persons as a class. Anticipating a U.S. Supreme Court decision on the merits of these arguments in June 2025, this essay uncovers the social metaphysics and political philosophy taken for granted by mainstream gender equality law which give rise to the neutral application loophole, and in so doing, proposes the first trans feminist alternative.</p>

            <p>Gender is a crucial part of the explanation for the substantive inequalities faced by trans people for being trans. Surprisingly, most feminist and trans philosophers today do not approach transgender equality meaningfully in gender equality terms. This essay develops and defends a trans feminist account that finally does. I start with the positive project of articulating this trans feminist account by distinguishing it from two leading analyses of transgender discrimination in U.S. law. I argue that transgender equality constitutes an issue of gender equality not because it has to do with sex understood as reproductive biology or sex stereotypes understood as the social roles and expectations of our assigned sex, but because it concerns the equality of persons systematically disadvantaged by the social meaning of our bodies being interpreted as trans—the equality of <em>trans persons</em> considered as a gender category for critical feminist analytical purposes. I then contrast my view with a gender-neutral, autonomy-based alternative currently popular in trans philosophy. The gender-neutral alternative fails, I conclude, precisely because it does not take the gender in transgender equality seriously.</p>

            <p>Leading philosophical accounts of ‘woman’ begin with what being a woman means to cis women within dominant social relations and cultural spaces, and then struggle to extend that analysis to trans women. I argue that the intense focus trans-inclusive feminism has placed on gender identity is, in this light, as well-meaning as it is misguided: the leading accounts invoke a concept of gender identity in order to retrofit trans people into a cis-centric analysis that wasn’t built for us in the first place; it is no surprise that they fall apart. Is there any hope, then, for a way out? Drawing on Kimberlé Crenshaw’s work on intersectional discrimination, I show that just as an analysis of gender discrimination that begins with what being a woman means to women of color incorporates rather than marginalizes white women’s relationship to womanhood (but not vice versa), an account of ‘woman’ that begins with what being a woman means to trans women incorporates rather than marginalizes cis women’s relationship to womanhood (but not vice versa).</p>

            <p>Euthyphro is a man and he identifies as a man. The <em>identity-first view</em> holds that Euthyphro is a man because he identifies as a man; the <em>gender-first view</em> proposes that it is the other way around. This paper offers the first trans feminist argument for the gender-first view, appealing to its explanatory power and proceeding in two stages. First, I show that the gender-first view has distinctive explanatory advantages in theorizing trans people’s genders on trans people’s own terms. Next, I suggest that not only does the main challenge facing the gender-first view also arise for the identity-first view, but in tackling it, a certain family of gender-first views can tap into conceptual resources not otherwise available to any identity-first alternatives. On balance, then, the gender-first view comes out as the far more metaphysically—and, I think, methodologically and politically—promising treatment of the relationship between gender and gender identity.</p>

            <p>What is sex? Is it a mere accident that the English term ‘sex’ refers to both an activity and a system of categorization? How does sex relate to gender and love, and how might the experiences of queer and trans people both complicate and illuminate these connections? What counts as having sex in the first place, and what counts as having good sex? How should we think about pregnancy, sexuality, consent, desire, pleasure, and love in connection to sexual autonomy and gender equality? This course surveys these central questions about sex, gender, and love, and in so doing, aims to introduce students to the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of social philosophy.</p>

Many of the topics we are going to discuss are more or less standard in a medical ethics course, such as harm, abortion, physician-assisted suicide, medical paternalism and patient autonomy. But what makes our course distinct is we will also look at critical approaches that seek to challenge and expand the traditional themes and positions. Specifically, we will consider feminist relational conceptions of autonomy, the continued debate between biological determinism and social constructivism, epistemic injustice in the practice of medicine, the politics of reproductive care and gender-affirming care, the medical policing of intersex, trans, racialized and disabled bodies, and the connection between lived experiences of the body and structural injustice. In so doing, our aim is to further explore the ethics of medical care in light of its broader political and social significance.</p>

It is raining a little. The sky is pinkish purple, and a giant rainbow sits above the city of Tucson in the distance. In the foreground, there are green shrubs with yellow little flowers blossoming. Everything looks fresh, serene, and in general just poetic and beautiful.">
