<h1 style="font-size: 1.2rem">Welcome!</h1>
<p>I’m a <a href="https://philosophy.arizona.edu/people/ding-zhiyuan-li">graduate student in philosophy</a> at the University of Arizona. I work primarily in social and political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of law, and feminist philosophy. I’m particularly interested in the ways in which metaphysical questions arising from the reality of gender variance and political questions about gender equality shed novel light on each other. At present, my research focuses on developing a realist account of gender that takes seriously the authenticity of trans/nonbinary people’s genders and exploring its implications for feminist political philosophy and philosophy of law.</p>
<p>Before moving to the gorgeous Sonoran Desert, I was so used to being buried in the heavy snow typical of Ohio’s winter while I studied at The Ohio State University. But in Chengdu, where I grew up, snow was also a rare treat (I still remember this one time in primary school, when our teacher canceled class just so we could go out and play with snow in the playground!), and so I’m feeling right at home now.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">A Note on My Name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">And a Note on Pronouns</h2>
<p>I go by <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they">they/them</a> (preferred if we don’t yet know each other) and she/her.</p>
