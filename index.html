<h1 style="font-size: 1.2rem">Welcome!</h1>
<p>I’m a <a href="https://philosophy.arizona.edu/people/ding-zhiyuan-li">graduate student in philosophy</a> at the University of Arizona. I’m most interested in issues arising at the intersection of political philosophy and metaphysics, especially those that implicate gender and LGBTQ+ equality. At present, my research focuses on the metaphysics of gender and its implications for our political and legal theory.</p>
<p>Before moving to the gorgeous Sonoran Desert, I was so used to being buried in the heavy snow typical of Ohio’s winter while I studied at The Ohio State University. But in Chengdu, where I grew up, snow was also a rare treat (I still remember this one time in primary school, when our teacher canceled class just so we could go out and play with snow in the playground!), and so I’m feeling right at home now.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">A Note on My Name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">And a Note on Pronouns</h2>
<p>I go by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/merriam-webster-they-word-year.html">they/them</a> (preferred if we don’t yet know each other) and she/her.</p>
