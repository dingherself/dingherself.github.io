<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>I’m a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. Starting this fall, I will be a doctoral student in the Department of Philosophy, University of Arizona.</p>

<p>I’m primarily interested in political and moral philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind. I have additional interests in the history of early analytic philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophical logic, and philosophical methodology. Still, what fascinate me most are questions that arise at the nexus of different areas of philosophy, and of philosophy and other disciplines.</p>

<h3>A Note on My Name</h3>

<p>While I was previously known as “Zhiyuan Li” (which remains my legal name), I would appreciate
being known professionally as “Ding” due to family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both
  a first name and a last name.</p>
