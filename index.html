<h1 style="font-size: 1.2rem">Welcome!</h1>
<p>I’m a graduate student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. I work primarily on issues at the intersection of political philosophy, feminist philosophy, metaphysics, and philosophy of law.</p>
<p>My current research considers the ways in which metaphysical questions about social categories and political questions about equality shed novel light on each other. I’ve been particularly interested in developing a realist account of gender that speaks to the deep authenticity of trans/nonbinary people’s lived experiences and exploring its implications for how we ought to live together.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">A Note on My Name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">And a Note on Pronouns</h2>
<p>I go by <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they">they/them</a> and she/her.</p>
