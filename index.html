<h1 style="font-size: 1.125rem; padding-top: 2pt;">Welcome!</h1>

<p>I’m a PhD student in philosophy at the University of Arizona. I work primarily on issues at the intersection of feminist political philosophy, social metaphysics, and philosophy of law.</p>

<p>My current research considers the underappreciated ways in which transgender equality not only poses pressing challenges to, but sheds novel light on, the meaning of gender equality. My dissertation develops a trans feminist account of gender equality that takes seriously both the gender (the social metaphysics) and the equality (the political philosophy), not just one or the other.</p>

<p>I’m apparently also on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dingherself">@dingherself</a>), for some reason.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">A note on my last name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1rem">And a note on pronouns</h2>
<p>I go by <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they">they/them</a> and she/her.</p>
