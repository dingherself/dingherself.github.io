<h1 style="font-size: 1.2rem">Welcome!</h1>
<p>I’m a <a href="https://philosophy.arizona.edu/people/ding-zhiyuan-li">graduate student in philosophy</a> at the University of Arizona. Before moving to the gorgeous Sonoran Desert, I was so used to being buried in the heavy snow typical of Ohio’s winter while I studied at The Ohio State University. But in Chengdu, where I grew up, snow is also a rare treat (I still remember this one time in primary school, when our teacher canceled class just so we could go out and play with snow in the playground!), and so I’m feeling right at home now.</p>
<p>As for the philosophical side of things, I’m most interested in issues that arise at the intersection of social & political philosophy and metaphysics, especially those that implicate gender equality and LGBTQ+ equality.</p>
<p>Outside academic philosophy, I’m really into <a href="https://www.dingphil.com/aviation/">aviation</a>. I taught visual effects as part of an Honors & Scholars program back at Ohio State for three years. I also build and maintain websites.</p>

<h2>A Note on My Name</h2>
<p>I do not use my legal last name for family-related reasons. “Ding” can function as both a first name and a last name.</p>

<h2>And a Note on Pronouns</h2>
<p>I go by “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/merriam-webster-they-word-year.html">they/them</a>.”</p>
