    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>My dissertation examines the challenges that transgender equality poses to our conception of gender equality, and in so doing, motivates and develops a trans feminist alternative.</p>
    <p>To account for transgender equality in a way that speaks to trans people’s lived genders and gender realities on trans people’s own terms, I argue that feminist theory needs to take seriously both the gender (the social metaphysics) and the equality (the political philosophy) of gender equality, not just one or the other.</p>

        <p>Defendants in U.S. trans equality cases now standardly argue that it is not conceptually possible for discriminatory legislation targeting transgender people to violate constitutional guarantees of gender equality, because such legislation equally applies to all transgender persons regardless of gender. In fact, many have gone further to argue that anti-trans legislation cannot even be said to target transgender people specifically, as the discrimination can be easily redescribed as applying to only persons diagnosed with gender dysphoria, only persons seeking gender-affirming care—but not trans persons as a class. Increasingly, courts are finding this <em>neutral application</em> defense persuasive, and even those sympathetic to trans plaintiffs have responded in ways that further essentialize gender and pathologize trans people. This essay uncovers the social metaphysics and political philosophy implicit in mainstream gender equality law that give rise to the neutral application defense, and in so doing, develops and defends the first trans feminist alternative.</p>

        <p>Philosophical discussions of gender have not adequately appreciated the metaphysical significance of the creative, collaborative practice through which trans people manage to invent and reinvent interpretations of our bodies that for the first time make genuine sense of who we are and how our bodies work on our own terms—a practice that I call <em>trans meaning crafting</em>. Drawing on a wide range of trans meaning crafting practice but focusing on queer trans women’s negotiation of sexual intimacy in particular, this essay offers a clear account of what trans meaning crafting is, develops a metaphysics that makes it plausible, and considers its implications for the philosophical literature on gender. Recognizing trans meaning crafting, I argue, helps to uncover an overlooked <em>empirical</em> and <em>explanatory</em> constraint on theories of gender, not just a moral and political one, as the literature is now increasingly turning to.</p>

        <p>Transgender equality constitutes a pressing issue of gender equality. Surprisingly, however, neither philosophy nor law has conceptualized transgender equality meaningfully in gender equality terms. This essay develops and defends a trans feminist account that finally does. I start with the positive project of articulating this trans feminist account by distinguishing it from two leading analyses of transgender discrimination in U.S. law. I argue that transgender equality is gender equality not because it has to do with sex understood as biology or sex stereotypes understood as the social roles and expectations of our assigned sex, but because transgender equality means the equality of persons systematically disadvantaged by the social meaning of our bodies being interpreted as trans—the equality of trans persons, where trans persons make up a gender category for feminist analytical purposes. I then consider a gender-neutral, autonomy-based alternative currently popular in trans philosophy. The gender-neutral alternative fails, I conclude, precisely because it does not take the gender in transgender equality seriously.</p>

        <p>Leading philosophical accounts of gender follow what I consider a <em>top-down</em> approach: they begin with what being a woman/man means to cis women/men and then struggle to extend that analysis to the rest of us. In this light, the intense focus that trans-inclusive feminism has placed on gender identity is, I worry, misguided: the leading accounts help themselves to a concept of gender identity in order to fit trans people into a cis-centric analysis that wasn’t built for us in the first place. This essay articulates and defends a trans feminist alternative—a <em>bottom-up</em> approach that begins from trans people’s own interpretation of our beautifully varied bodies on our own terms. Such a bottom-up approach is distinctive in its reversal of the explanatory relation between gender and gender identity: trans people identify as the gender we say we are because we <em>are</em> that gender, not the other way around.</p>

        <p>In this course, we will examine a variety of normative issues in and about medicine. Many of the topics we are going to discuss are more or less standard in a medical ethics course, such as harm, abortion, physician-assisted suicide, medical paternalism and patient autonomy. But what makes our course distinct is we will also look at critical approaches that seek to challenge and expand the traditional themes and positions. Specifically, we will consider feminist relational conceptions of autonomy, the continued debate between biological determinism and social constructivism, epistemic injustice in the practice of medicine, the politics of reproductive care and gender-affirming care, the medical policing of intersex, trans, racialized and disabled bodies, and the connection between lived experiences of the body and structural injustice. In so doing, our aim is to further explore the ethics of medical care in light of its broader political and social significance.</p>
