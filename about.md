# About Me

I'm a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. I have a very broad range of interests in philosophy and connected fields (e.g. linguistics, neuroscience, sociology, political science, computer science). But some of the questions that currently trouble me most are in normative ethics (especially how to deal with moral considerations about future people), political philosophy (especially political obligations under authoritarian states and non-ideal theories of justice), metaphysics (especially mind, consciousness, social kinds and social construction) and history of philosophy (especially early analytic philosophy and early modern philosophy).

I'm also very passionate about writing philosophy in a way that's accessible to the general public (I contributed ~30 pieces of public writings to the Chinese website *Zhihu* [\[My Profile\]](https://www.zhihu.com/people/shannon403) with ~6000 likes and thanks) and perhaps quite paradoxically, the logical (formal) treatment of philosophy.

Besides philosophy, I regularly teach After Effects (an industry standard program for motion graphics and visual effects) for the University's [Media, Marketing and Communication Scholars](http://mmcscholars.com/home/) Program. I'm a huge fan of aviation, too. I run a virtual airline online (see our [schedules and routes](https://otto.airlinesim.aero/app/info/enterprises/933)), and I keep track of the [airports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airports.md %}) I've been to and [airliners]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airliners.md %}) I've flown on. You can also view my flight map [here](https://my.flightradar24.com/shannon403).

I can be reached via email ([personal](mailto:{{ 'ding@dingphil.com' | encode_email }}) or [university](mailto:{{ 'li.6587@osu.edu' | encode_email }})).
