# About Me

I am a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. What especially interest me are questions that arise at the interesctions of different areas of philosophy---such as moral and political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophical logic---and of philosophy and other fields of study---such as neurosicence, linguistics, computer science, sociology, and political science. And I am very interested in the history of analytic philosophy. Besides, I co-coordinate the feminist philosophy reading group [Aspasia](https://blog.aspasiaphilosophy.com).

Besides philosophy, I regularly teach After Effects (an industry standard program for motion graphics and visual effects) for the University's [Media, Marketing and Communication Scholars](http://mmcscholars.com/home/) Program. I am a huge fan of aviation, too. I run a virtual airline online (see our [schedules and routes](https://otto.airlinesim.aero/app/info/enterprises/933)), and I keep track of the [airports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airports.md %}) I have been to and [airliners]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airliners.md %}) I have flown on. You can also view my flight map [here](https://my.flightradar24.com/shannon403).

I can be reached via email ([personal](mailto:{{ 'ding@dingphil.com' | encode_email }}) or [university](mailto:{{ 'li.6587@osu.edu' | encode_email }})).
