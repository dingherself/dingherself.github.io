# About Me

I'm a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. What especially interest me are questions that arise at the interesctions of different areas of philosophy---such as moral and political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophical logic---and of philosophy and other fields of study---such as neurosicence, linguistics, computer science, sociology, and political science. Besides, I'm also very interested in the history and development of analytic philosophy, the kind(s?) of philosophy practiced in the majority of philosophy departments across the English-speaking world.

Apart from philosophy, I regularly teach After Effects (an industry standard program for motion graphics and visual effects) for the University's [Media, Marketing and Communication Scholars](http://mmcscholars.com/home/) program. I'm a huge fan of aviation, too. I run a virtual airline online (see our [schedules and routes](https://otto.airlinesim.aero/app/info/enterprises/933)), and I keep track of the [airliners]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airliners.md %}) I have flown on and the [airports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airports.md %}) I have been to. You can view my flight map [here](https://my.flightradar24.com/shannon403).

The best way to contact me is via email: {{ 'ding@dingphil.com' | encode_email }}.
