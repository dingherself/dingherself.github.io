# About Me

I'm a senior philosophy major at The Ohio State University. What especially interest me are questions that arise at the interesctions of different areas of philosophy---such as moral and political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophical logic---and of philosophy and other fields of study---such as neurosicence, linguistics, computer science, sociology, and political science. Besides, I'm very interested in the history of analytic philosophy. I also co-coordinate the feminist philosophy reading group [Aspasia](https://blog.aspasiaphilosophy.com).

Apart from philosophy, I regularly teach After Effects (an industry standard program for motion graphics and visual effects) for the University's [Media, Marketing and Communication Scholars](http://mmcscholars.com/home/) program. I'm a huge fan of aviation, too. I run a virtual airline online (see our [schedules and routes](https://otto.airlinesim.aero/app/info/enterprises/933)), and I keep track of the [airliners]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airliners.md %}) I have flown on and the [airports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link aviation/airports.md %}) I have been to. You can view my flight map [here](https://my.flightradar24.com/shannon403).

The best way to contact me is via email ([personal](mailto:{{ 'ding@dingphil.com' | encode_email }}) or [university](mailto:{{ 'li.6587@osu.edu' | encode_email }})).
