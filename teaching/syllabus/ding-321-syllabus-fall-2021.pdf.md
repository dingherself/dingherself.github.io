I’m currently dealing with targeted harassment and intimidation by a [far-right organization](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/tpusas-charlie-kirk-trans-people) on the basis of my gender and race. I have decided to take my website temporarily offline as a precaution. If you are in my class, you can find my office and email in the course syllabus. I’m really sorry about all this.
