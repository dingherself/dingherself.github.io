(2) Create a text. Make it a 3D layer. Since we are working with ray-traced 3D, we can add **extrusions** under geometry options:

(3) Create a solid as the floor (needs to be big). Use a camera to help with navigation.

(4) Create a **light**. Set its type to **Ambient**. Use it to provide background lighting.

(5) Create another light. Set its type to **Spot** or **Parallel**. Turn on **Casts Shadow**. Use it to create spotlight animation.
