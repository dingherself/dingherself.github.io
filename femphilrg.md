#### FemPhilRG

<p class="text-center"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n-VEwH8IkUWVDCQpIrjGEdn4rRPTnz6fei1bDTYJC3Y/edit?usp=sharing">Spring 2020 Reading Schedule</a><br /><small>(UA Account Needed)</small></p>

For Spring 2020, the **Feminist Philosophy Reading Group** will be meeting every Wednesday from 1:00 to 2:30 in the Kendrick Seminar Room, Social Sciences Building 128. Our first meeting of the semester will be on January 15, 2020. We will mainly be reading Elizabeth Barnes’s book *The Minority Body* this spring, but we are also hoping to invite people from our own and other departments to give talks or present papers.

The manifest function of FemPhilRG is, of course, to read and discuss feminist philosophy, but we also have at least two broader aims in mind: First, we would like to create and maintain a physical space in the department to serve as an anchor for **community building**. Second,  in addition to promoting **feminist** viewpoints in the department, we are looking forward to bringing in **interdisciplinary** perspectives and **continental** insights as well.

Our meetings are open to the UA community. If you are interested in participating, please let me know!
