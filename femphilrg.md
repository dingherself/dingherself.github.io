#### FemPhil RG

<p class="text-center"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n-VEwH8IkUWVDCQpIrjGEdn4rRPTnz6fei1bDTYJC3Y/edit?usp=sharing">Spring 2020 Reading Schedule</a><br /><small>(UA Account Needed)</small></p>
For Spring 2020, the **Feminist Philosophy Reading Group** will be meeting every Wednesday from 1:00 to 2:30 in the Kendrick Seminar Room, Social Sciences Building 128. We will mainly be reading Elizabeth Barnes’s book *The Minority Body* this semester. We are also hoping to invite people to give talks or present drafts.

The manifest function of FemPhil RG is, of course, to read and discuss feminist philosophy, but we have two broader aims in mind: First, we would like to create and maintain a physical space in the department to serve as an anchor for community building. Second, in addition to promoting feminist viewpoints in the department, we are looking forward to bringing in interdisciplinary perspectives and continental insights as well.

If you are interested in participating, please feel free to contact me.
