# FemPhil RG

For Fall 2021, the **Feminist Philosophy Reading Group** will meet every Monday from 1 to 2:30pm. Our plan this semester is to read Nel Noddings’s *Caring* and part of Carol Gilligan’s *In a Different Voice*.

While the manifest function of the reading group is to read and discuss feminist philosophy, we also hope that it will help maintain a physical space in the department and serve as an anchor for community building.
