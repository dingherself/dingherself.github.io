# FemPhil RG

For Spring 2021, the **Feminist Philosophy Reading Group** will meet every other week on Tuesday from 1:30 to 3pm. Our plan is to read Miranda Fricker’s *Epistemic Injustice* from cover to cover.

While the manifest function of the reading group is to read and discuss feminist philosophy, we also hope that it will help maintain a physical (virtual now!) space in the department and serve as an anchor for community building.

Graduate students both in and outside philosophy are more than welcome to participate! If you are interested, please just send me an email.
