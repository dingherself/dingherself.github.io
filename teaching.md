##### PHIL 324: Law and Morality (Summer 2020, Online, 5 Week 2)

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of law in general and feminist philosophy of law in particular. We will consider several significant issues that arise at the intersection of law and morality, and explore their jurisprudential and philosophical implications. ([Syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus/ding-324-syllabus-summer-2020.pdf %}))

		<p>What is the relationship between law and morality? Can a morally indefensible law nonetheless be <em>legally</em> valid? If so, do we also have a <em>moral</em> obligation to obey such a law just because it is the law? Is civil disobedience ever justifiable, and, if so, under what conditions? When judges interpret the law, do they follow moral principles even if those principles were never really enacted by a legislature? Should they? Is there even a <em>right</em> answer as to how a case should be decided, distinguishable from the final answer given by a court of last resort such as the US Supreme Court (or as it is increasingly the case, a narrow 5–4 majority)? In this course, we survey leading answers to these questions from the philosophy of law.</p>
		<p>Our aim is not only to consider philosophical puzzles about the relationship between law and morality, but also to investigate their jurisprudential implications for a variety of issues of concern to feminist, antiracist philosophy of law: We revisit the Supreme Court's historic decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954) to declare the racial segregation of public education inherently unequal. We trace the development of the Court's gender equality jurisprudence and critically assess its adequacy. We consider the way gender discrimination may be obscured by a lack of appreciation of intersectionality. We also look at the Court's very recent holding in <em>Bostock v. Clayton County </em> (2020) that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity constitutes <em>sex</em> discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Finally, we turn to issues of <em>substantive</em> gender inequality. We closely study the Court's abortion jurisprudence, including its landmark decision in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> (1973) to recognize a fundamental right to abortion. We examine competing proposals to reform the traditional legal definition of rape as sex that has to be both forcible and nonconsensual. And we conclude the course with reflections on another recent case, <em>Doe v. Boyertown Area School District</em> (2018), in which the Third Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the school district's policy to allow transgender students to access sex-segregated spaces according to their gender identity.</p>
		<p>It will probably come as no surprise that these are also some of the most contentious issues that just so easily end up dividing us. By introducing you to~the analytical tools that legal and moral philosophy has to offer, the broader aim of this course is to help you learn to engage in sincere and reflective dialogues with your peers, to defend and criticize views with reasoned arguments and responses, and, perhaps most importantly, to think <em>for</em> yourself.</p>
