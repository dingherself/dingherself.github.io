#### Upcoming Courses

##### PHIL 324: Law and Morality (Summer 2020, Online, 5 Week 2)

###### Overview

What is the relationship between law and morality? Can a morally questionable law nonetheless be *legally* valid, and, if so, do we also have a *moral* obligation to obey such a law just because it is the law? Moreover, can the state be morally justified in legislating against private, consensual behavior just because it violates a shared sense of what's right or wrong in that society? In the first half of this course, we survey four leading answers to these questions from the philosophy of law: legal positivism, natural law theory, legal interpretivism and legal realism.

In the second half of the course, we move on to consider how conceptual puzzles about the relationship between law and morality become particularly relevant in a variety of practical cases from feminist jurisprudence. We revisit the Court's historic decision in *Roe v. Wade* (1973) to recognize a fundamental right to abortion, which bears closely on the concept of personhood and women's reproductive autonomy and bodily integrity; the Court's highly split decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) to uphold same-sex marriage, which once again highlights the question of whether, and, if so, under what circumstances the state can enforce morality by law; various rape cases that raise serious worries about the legal and moral notions of sexual consent and autonomy; and finally, a recent case *Doe v. Boyertown Area School District* (2018) in which the Third Circuit upheld the school district's policy to allow trans students access to sex-segregated spaces.

It will probably come as no surprise that these are also some of the most contentious issues that just so easily end up dividing us. By introducing you to the analytical tools that legal and moral philosophies have to offer, the broader aim of this course is to help you learn to engage in sincere and reflective dialogues with your peers, to defend and criticize views with reasoned arguments and responses, and perhaps most importantly, to think *for* yourself.
