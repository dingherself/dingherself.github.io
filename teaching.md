## Phil 324: Law and Morality (Summer 2020, Online, 5 Week 2)

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of law in general and feminist philosophy of law in particular. We will consider several significant issues at the intersection of law and morality, and explore their jurisprudential and philosophical implications.

		<p>What is the relationship between law and morality? Can a morally indefensible law nonetheless be <em>legally</em> valid? Is civil disobedience ever justifiable, and, if so, under what circumstances? When judges interpret the law, do they follow moral principles even if those principles were never really enacted into the law by a legislature? Should they? Is there even a <em>right</em> answer as to how a case should be decided, distinguishable from the final answer given by a court of last resort such as the U.S. Supreme Court? In this course, we will survey leading answers to these questions from the philosophy of law and consider their jurisprudential implications for a variety of issues, especially those of concern to feminist, antiracist legal theory: First, we will consider the arguments behind the Supreme Court’s landmark holdings in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954) that the racial segregation of public education is inherently unequal, and in <em>Loving v. Virginia</em> (1967) that a Virginia law criminalizing interracial marriage unconstitutional. Second, we will examine the development of the Court’s gender equality jurisprudence and critically assess its adequacy, attending especially to ways in which gender inequality may be obscured by a lack of appreciation of intersectional discrimination and structural subordination. To illustrate intersectional discrimination, we will look at the Court’s very recent holding in <em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em> (2020) that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity necessarily constitutes <em>sex</em> discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As for structural subordination, we will turn to Catharine MacKinnon’s enormously influential argument that sexual harassment constitutes an indefensible form of sex <em>discrimination</em>. We will then apply these important insights to two rapidly developing areas of law—reproductive freedom and transgender students’ rights at school.</p>
