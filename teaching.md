## Courses

### Phil 324: Law and Morality (Online, Summer 2021)

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of law in general and feminist philosophy of law in particular. We will consider several significant philosophical issues at the intersection of law and morality and explore their jurisprudential implications.

Topics will include the nature of law, judicial discretion, constitutional and statutory interpretation, civil disobedience, racial equality, gender equality, sexual harassment, reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ+ equality.

### Phil 321: Medical Ethics (Tentatively In-Person, Fall 2021)

In this course, we will examine a variety of normative issues in and about health care. Many of the topics we are going to discuss are more or less standard in a medical ethics course, such as medical paternalism, informed consent, doing harm, physician-assisted suicide, and abortion. But what makes our course distinct is we will also look at critical approaches that seek to challenge and expand the traditional themes and positions. Specifically, we will consider feminist relational conceptions of autonomy, epistemic injustice in the practice of medicine, the continued debate between biological determinism and social constructivism, the politics of reproductive care and gender-affirming care, the medical policing of intersex, trans, disabled and racialized bodies, and the connection between lived experiences of the body and structural injustice. In so doing, our aim is to further explore the ethics of health care in light of its broader political and social significance.
