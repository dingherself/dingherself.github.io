# Upcoming Courses

## Summer 2021

### Phil 324: Law and Morality (Online, 5 Week 1 & 5 Week 2)

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of law in general and feminist philosophy of law in particular. We will consider several significant philosophical issues at the intersection of law and morality and explore their jurisprudential implications.

Topics will include the nature of law, judicial discretion, constitutional and statutory interpretation, civil disobedience, racial equality, gender equality, sexual harassment, reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ+ equality.

## Fall 2021

### Phil 321: Medical Ethics (Tentatively In-Person)

In this course, we will examine a variety of normative issues in and about health care. We will start by surveying some of the topics you will likely come across in a standard medical ethics course, including medical paternalism, informed consent, truth-telling, confidentiality, physician-assisted suicide and the use of placebos in medical research. But what makes this course distinct is we will also look at critical approaches that seek to challenge and expand the traditional themes and positions. Specifically, we will consider feminist relational conceptions of autonomy, the politics of reproductive care and gender-affirming care, the continued debate between biological determinism and social constructivism, the medical policing of intersex, trans, disabled and racialized bodies, and the connection between lived experiences of the body and structural injustice. In so doing, our aim is to critically assess the ethics of health care in light of its broader political and social significance.
