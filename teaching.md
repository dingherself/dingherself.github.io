## Phil 324: Law and Morality (Summer 2020, Online, 5 Week 2)

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of law in general and feminist philosophy of law in particular. We will consider several significant issues at the intersection of law and morality, and explore their jurisprudential and philosophical implications.

		<p>What is the relationship between law and morality? Can a morally indefensible law nonetheless be <em>legally</em> valid? If so, do we have a <em>moral</em> obligation to obey such a law just because it is the law? Is civil disobedience ever justifiable, and, if so, under what circumstances? When judges interpret the law, do they follow moral principles even if those principles were never really enacted into the law by a legislature? Should they? Is there even a <em>right</em> answer as to how a case should be decided, distinguishable from the final answer given by a court of last resort such as the U.S. Supreme Court (or, as it has increasingly been the case, a narrow 5–4 majority)? In this course, we survey leading answers to these questions from the philosophy of law. We then consider their jurisprudential implications for a variety of issues of concern to feminist, antiracist philosophy of law: First, we consider the arguments behind the Supreme Court’s landmark holdings in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> (1954) that the racial segregation of public education is inherently unequal, and in <em>Loving v. Virginia</em> (1967) that a Virginia law criminalizing interracial marriage unconstitutional. Second, we examine the development of the Court’s gender equality jurisprudence and critically assess its adequacy, attending especially to ways in which gender inequality may be obscured by a lack of appreciation of structural subordination and intersectionality. Here, we also look at the Court’s very recent holding in <em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em> (2020) that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity necessarily constitutes <em>sex</em> discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Last but not least, we turn to issues of <em>substantive</em> gender inequality. We examine major developments in the Court’s abortion jurisprudence, including <em>Roe v. Wade</em> (1973), <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> (1992), <em>Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt</em> (2016), and, most recently, <em>June Medical Services v. Russo</em> (2020). We consider competing proposals to reform the traditional legal definition of rape as sex that has to be both forcible and nonconsensual. And we conclude the course with critical reflections on a rapidly developing new area of law—transgender rights. Our case study here is <em>Doe v. Boyertown Area School District</em> (2018), in which the Third Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the school district’s policy of allowing transgender students to access sex-segregated spaces in accordance with their gender identity, but declined to decide whether trans-inclusive access policies are <em>demanded</em> by the Constitution or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.</p>
		<p>It will probably come as no surprise that these include some of the most contentious issues that just so easily end up dividing us. By introducing you to the analytical tools that legal and moral philosophy has to offer, the broader aim of this course is to help you learn to engage in sincere and reflective dialogues with your peers, to defend and criticize views with reasoned arguments and responses, and, perhaps most importantly, to think critically <em>for</em> yourself.</p>
