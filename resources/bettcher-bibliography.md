# Bettcher Bibliography

\[I compiled this bibliography of Talia Mae Bettcher’s work (including some spoken word performances that I came across in my research) for a reading group that I organized in 2022. To me, reading Bettcher systematically has been enormously helpful in understanding and appreciating her work, and I wish all trans/feminist philosophers could have the delight (as well as luxury) of doing the same.\]
