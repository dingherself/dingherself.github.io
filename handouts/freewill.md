<em>This is a handout for the final presentation I gave at the “Philosophy and Science of Free Will” short summer course at Renmin University of China in 2017.

<span><span>Presenter: Ziyuan Li (Undergraduate, The Ohio State University)</span></span>

<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading"><span>Two Compatibilist Theses</span></h2>
<span><span><em>Compatibilism</em></span><span> holds that (causal) determinism is compatible with free will (the sort of which is required for moral responsibility). We discussed two sorts of compatibilism during class:</span></span>
<ol class="ol-list">
 	<li><span><span><em>Hierarchical Compatibilism</em></span> (HC): An agent has free will <em>iff</em> she identifies her action with the will she wants; or</span></li>
 	<li><span><span><em>Reasons-Responsive Compatibilism</em></span><span> (RRC): An agent has free will <em>iff</em> she is responsive to rational considerations for or against her action.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading"><span>The Manipulation Objection</span></h2>
<h3><span>The M<span>anipulation Cases</span></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>Suppose an agent <span><em>S</em></span> was manipulated in a particular manner <span><em>M</em></span> to perform an action <span><em>A</em></span>, and <span><em>M</em></span><span> satisfies all the requirements for free will as proposed by both HC and RRC. Because of this, </span><span><em>S</em></span> should have <span><em>A-ed</em></span> freely and be held responsible for <span><em>A-ing</em></span>, according to compatibilism (regardless of what particular sort of compatibilism one endorses).</span></p>
<span contenteditable="">Call such cases <em>manipulation cases</em>. Take "killing White" as <span><em>A</em></span><span>, and suppose had </span><span><em>S</em></span><span> not been manipulated in </span><span><em>M</em></span>, <span><em>S</em></span><span> would have not </span><span><em>A-ed</em></span><span>. Then consider the following four </span><span><em>M</em></span><span>’s:</span></span>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>M1</em></span><span>: Before S began to reason about her situation, </span><span><em>S</em></span><span> was made to operate on strongly egoistic reasoning by some evil neuroscientists which would deterministically result in </span><span><em>S</em></span><span>’s decision to </span><span><em>A</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>M2</em></span>: At the birth of <span><em>S</em></span>, <span><em>S</em></span><span> was programmed to operate on strongly egoistic reasoning by some evil neuroscientists which would deterministically result in </span><span><em>S</em></span>’s decision to <span><em>A</em></span>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>M3</em></span>: <span><em>S</em></span>’s operating on strongly egoistic reason which would deterministically result in <span><em>S’s</em></span> decision to <span><em>A</em></span><span> was causally determined by the educational practices of her community.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>M4</em></span>: <span><em>S</em></span>’s operating on strongly egoistic reason which would deterministically result in <span><em>S’s</em></span> decision to <span><em>A</em></span><span> was causally determined by past events together with the laws of nature.</span></span></p>

<h3>The Local Objection <span contenteditable=""><span>(Utilizing only </span><span><em>M1</em></span>)</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>P1</em></span>: If compatibilism is true, then if <span><em>M</em></span> satisfies the requirements for free will set forth by compatibilism, <span><em>S</em></span> should have <span><em>A-ed</em></span> freely and is morally responsible for <span><em>A-ing</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>P2</em></span><span>: Compatibilism (either HC or RRC) is true.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>P3</em></span>: <span><em>M1</em></span><span> satisfies all requirements for free will set forth by compatibilism (regardless of what sort), so </span><span><em>S</em></span> should have <span><em>A-ed</em></span> freely and is morally responsible for <span><em>A-ing</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>P4</em></span>: But intuitively, <span><em>S</em></span> did not <span><em>A</em></span><span> freely, and is not morally responsible, given <em>M1</em>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span contenteditable=""><span><em>P5</em></span>: Therefore, <span><em>P1</em></span><span> is false, and the compatibilist requirements is not sufficient for free will and moral responsibility.</span></span></p>

<h3>The Global Objection <span contenteditable=""><span>(Utilizing </span><span><em>M1 </em>to <em>M4</em></span>)</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q1</em></span>: If compatibilism is true, then if <span><em>M</em></span> satisfies the requirements for free will set forth by compatibilism, <span><em>S</em></span> should have <span><em>A-ed</em></span> freely and is morally responsible for <span><em>A-ing</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q2</em></span><span>: Compatibilism (either HC or RRC) is true.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q3</em></span>: Each of <span><em>M1</em></span> to <span><em>M4</em></span> satisfies all requirements for free will set <span>forth </span>by compatibilism (regardless of what sort), so <span><em>S</em></span> should have <span><em>A-ed</em></span> freely and is morally responsible for <span><em>A-ing</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q4</em></span>: But intuitively, <span><em>S</em></span> did not <span><em>A</em></span> freely, and is not morally responsible, given <span><em>M1</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q5</em></span>: There are no responsibility-relevant differences among <span><em>M1</em></span> to <span><em>M4</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q6</em></span>: So, <span><em>S</em></span> did not <span><em>A</em></span> freely, and is not morally responsible, given <span><em>M4</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q7</em></span>: But by virtue of <em>Q3</em>, <span><em>S</em></span> <span><em>A-ed</em></span> freely, and is morally responsible, given <span><em>M4</em></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span><em>Q8</em></span><span>: Considering that <em>M4 </em>is ordinarily deterministic, we can reject <em>Q2</em>. Therefore, compatibilism (either HC or RRC) is false.</span></span></p>

<h2 class="md-end-block md-heading">Replies to the Manipulation Objection</h2>
<h3 class="md-end-block md-heading">Rejecting the Local Objection</h3>
<span><span>In <em>M1,</em></span> <span><em>S</em></span>’s psychological states (particularly her reasoning processes) were altered by the evil neuroscientists. In that sense, <span><em>S</em></span>’s reasoning processes were alienated, coming from outside, and beyond her control. But RRC requires at least some degrees of control, and thus <span><em>M1</em></span> does not meet its requirement. Similarly, although <span><em>S</em></span> formed a first-order desire to want to <span><em>A</em></span>, she did not want to A because she wanted to want to A -- the neuroscientists wanted <span><em>S</em></span> to want to <span><em>A</em></span>. For these two reasons, <span><em>P3</em></span> does not obtain.</span>
<h3 class="md-end-block md-heading">Rejecting the Global Objection</h3>
<span><span>For the same reasons, Q3 does not obtain.</span></span>

<h3>The Transitivity Reply</h3>
If <em>M1</em> fails to meet the requirements of compatibilism, so does <em>M4</em>. In other words, <em>S </em>did not <i>A </i>freely and is not responsible for <em>A-ing, </em>given <em>M4</em>, which is an ordinary deterministic condition. But it is you compatibilists that argue determinism is compatible with free will?

Possible moves for compatibilists: Deny <em>M4</em> fails to meet requirements (thereby denying transitivity?)
