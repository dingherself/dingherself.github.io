I met ANA's JA615A (Boeing 767-300ER) again at Kansai Kuukou (KIX) on May 6, 2017:

I was on JA615A (almost) exactly a year ago, on May 4, 2016.  It was my first experience with ANA---a connecting flight (NH921) from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to my final destination, Shanghai Pudong (PVG). This time I was returning from a short vacation in Japan to Beijing (PEK). Originally, the flight (NH979) was scheduled to be operated by a Boeing 737-800, but I was more than to happy to be on board JA615A!

My flight returning home from Beijing was operated by a Hainan Airlines A330-300 (B8287). The aircraft was named "Hai! Manchester" to celebrate the airline's Beijing=Manchester service that started the previous year.

And a Kung Fu Panda Boeing 787-9 (B-1540) was parked next to ours!

On my departure back to the United States, I encountered ANA's another Boeing 767 in Chengdu (CTU):

It was NH948 to Tokyo Narita (NRT). I had flown on that route once, so I was more or less expecting seeing it. My flight that day was UA8 to San Francisco (SFO), operated by a Boeing 787-8 (N27908). In previous years, United Airlines added several routes to 2nd-tier cities in China, but unfortunately, most of them didn't work out and were later discontinued. It seems that Chengdu is now the only destination left which UA regularly flies to, apart from Beijing and Shanghai.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/IMG_0077.jpg %}"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1174" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/IMG_0077-1024x576.jpg %}" alt="" width="700" height="394" /></a> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/IMG_0078.jpg %}"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1175" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/images/IMG_0078-1024x576.jpg %}" alt="" width="700" height="394" /></a>

The last highlight was on January 4, 2018. My original plan was to take CA819 from Beijing (PEK) to New York Newark (EWR), but it was delayed almost indefinitely due to heavy snow in New York. Air China rebooked me to CA995, which was a 13-hour flight to Housten (IAH). It sounded better than its reverse, CA996, though. CA996 is <em>the</em> most boring flight I've ever flown: It's 15 hours long, with two meal services ("Chicken rice or pork rice?") at the first 90 and last 90 minutes, respectively, and literally nothing else to do in the 12 hours in between! But CA995 turns out to be the most unfortunate flight for me, as the tray table crushed my iPad and I accidentally spilled coke on my neighbor and myself, thanks to the congested seating space.

Despite all that, this view simply cannot fade away from my mind:

The plane taking off is an Air China A330-200 (B6081), en route (CA4108) to my hometown Chengdu (CTU). I was (once again!) on that plane home exactly a year ago, on January 3, 2017. But today, I was going the opposite direction, leaving home.

The other three are (from left to right): United Airline's Boeing 777-200ER (N78008, UA89) from New York Newark (EWR), ANA's Boeing 777-300ER (JA787A, NH962) from Tokyo Haneda (HND), and Air China's A321 (B6593).
