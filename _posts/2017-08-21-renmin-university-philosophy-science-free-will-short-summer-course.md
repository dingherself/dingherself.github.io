This summer (July 3--8), I attended the "Philosophy and Science of Free Will" short summer course at Renmin University of China in Beijing. The course was hosted by Renmin University's Center for Analytic Philosophy, and the instructors were Derk Pereboom (philosophy; Cornell) and Marcel Brass (neuroscience; Ghent). I received travel funds from the Center which helped make my participation possible.

At the end of the course, I gave a final presentation on behalf of my group, proposing a reply to Professor Pereboom's manipulation argument against compatibilism. Professor Pereboom and Professor Brass commented on my presentation (and they had a heated debate for quite a while). An (environmentally friendly) handout can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link handouts/freewill.md %}).

I, with my free will, enjoyed this short summer course very much. I learned a lot from the course, and I'm very thankful to the instructors and the Center (which provided the course for free).
