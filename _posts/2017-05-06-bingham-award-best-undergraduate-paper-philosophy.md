In April, a paper of mine was selected as this year's best undergraduate paper by the philosophy department, and I was awarded the annual <a href="https://philosophy.osu.edu/bingham-award">Bingham Award</a> for this. My paper is on David Benatar and anti-natalism. On April 11, I presented a shortened version of the paper at a department ceremony.
